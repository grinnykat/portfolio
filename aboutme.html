Hello! My name is Kaitlyn, and I'm sixteen years old! I currently go to Alameda High School. I've always wanted to learn how to code, but never actually pursued it until now.

In my free time - literally any free time I may have - I love to draw; it's something I've done constantly since I was little, and continue to do until now. Other than drawing, I also really like writing! All the novels I've completed are old, though, and I try not to think about them because they're so cringe-worthy.

<h3>FUN FACT!!</h3>

The reason I became interested in learning is because I want to make my own game...but I found out that, other than art, it requires coding. So, I planned on self-teaching myself...but that literally never goes to plan. I've been working on this game for about four years now! It's been created and scrapped about four to five times, and I'm still trying to develop it.
